    <string name="about_info_text">Textile Dict was created with the aim to help textile majors look up English words in
        an easy and understandable way. The application has absolutely no ads, is not created for the purpose of making
        money. However, I still listen to your suggestions to make the application more and more perfect, and I promise
        to spend as much time as possible to perfect the application according to your suggestions that I can do. Any
        comments please leave a comment below the application or send a mail to devhw95@gmail.com.
